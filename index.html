            New York City is uniquely positioned to feel the impacts of the climate crisis. From Superstorm Sandy, a wakeup call in 2012 that killed 44 people and caused $19 billion in damages, to the remnants of Hurricane Ida in 2021, which killed 13 people and exposed the dangers of unregulated basement apartments, it’s clear that the effects of climate change will only worsen. <p>

            Last year, the New York City Council passed a law that will require the mayor’s office and city government to develop a plan to mitigate “climate hazards,” including extreme weather and heat. The measure requires the plan to be updated every 10 years. The city is also working under OneNYC2050, a strategic plan to address the climate crisis. <p>
            
            The city already has several climate change resiliency projects underway. <p>
            
            In the Bronx, the Hunts Point Resiliency project aims to provide sustainable power to Hunts Point through energy generation and storage solutions. The project will implement a microgrid, solar power and storage at two public schools in the area, and mobile diesel generators. <p>
            
            Three ongoing projects in Manhattan will address the risks of the climate crisis on the island. Resilient East Harlem aims to reduce the neighborhood’s vulnerabilities to storm surge, sea level rise and extreme rain by managing stormwater, creating resilient public spaces and adapting the waterfront. <p>
            
            The embattled East Side Coastal Resiliency Project has faced strong opposition from neighborhood residents, who have organized against the city’s plan to tear down East River Park and rebuild it at a raised level. But community activists recently lost a court battle to halt the project, which aims to mitigate the effects of flooding and sea level rise from coastal storms. <p>
            
            The Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency project also aims to address the impacts of rising sea levels and coastal storms. The plan will extend the shoreline of the East River to a multilevel waterfront, with the goal of protecting the city from rising sea levels while providing residents with more access to the waterfront.
